Template6: A Template Engine for Perl 6
---------------------------------------

Inspired by Template Toolkit from Perl 5,
Template6 is a simple template engine designed to be
a content-neutral template language.

Eventually, I intend for this to be as powerful as
Template Toolkit, but for now I'm keeping it simple
and leaving it capable of easily adding new functionality.

I also intend to borrow features and ideas from
my own Flower and Garden projects.

== Currently implemented features ==

* get and set statements, including implicit versions.
  [% get varname %]
  [% varname %]
  [% set varname = value %]
  [% varname = value %]
* for statement.
  This replaces the FOREACH statement in TT2.
  It can be used in one of four ways:
    [% for listname as itemname %]
    [% for listname -> itemname %]
    [% for itemname in listname %]
    [% for itemname = listname %]
* if/elsif/else/unless statements.
  These as very simplistic at the moment.
