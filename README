NanoTT: A Template Engine for Perl 6
---------------------------------------

Inspired by Template Toolkit and TT3 from Perl 5,
NanoTT is a simple template engine designed to be
easy to use and more generic than my previous Flower
and Garden engines.

Unlike Flower, it works with any form of textual content,
and unlike Garden, well, it's a sane design.

More to come soon as I plan out exactly what form this
engine is going to take. Unlike Garden, I'm not planning
this to be multi-language. If you're using Perl 5, use one of
the existing engines like Template Toolkit. This is for Perl 6 only.
